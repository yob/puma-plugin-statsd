# Puma Statsd Plugin

[Puma][puma] integration with [statsd][statsd] for easy tracking of key metrics
that puma can provide:

Gauges:

* puma.workers - The number of distinct processes running. In single mode this will be 1, in cluster mode the number of worker processes
* puma.old_workers - The number of worker processes that are about to be shut down as part of a phased restart. Will normally be 0
* puma.booted_workers - The number of worker processes that are in a booted state
* puma.running - The number of worker threads currently running. In quiet times, idle threads may be shutdown if the number of threads exceeds the configured minimum, but they'll start back up again when traffic arrives
* puma.backlog - The number of requests that have made it to a worker but are yet to be processed. This will be zero if queue_requests is disabled, as requests will only queue on the tcp/unix socket in front of the master puma process, but not in the worker thread pool
* puma.pool_capacity - The number of idle and unspawned worker threads. When this is low/zero, puma is running at full capacity and might need scaling up
* puma.max_threads - The maximum number of worker threads that might run at one time
* puma.percent_busy - The percentage of busy threads, calculated as the percentage of capacity in use relative to the maximum number of threads
* puma.requests_count - Total number of requests served by this puma since it started

Counters:

* puma.requests - The number of requests served since the previous report

## Installation

Add this gem to your Gemfile with puma and then bundle:

```ruby
gem "puma"
gem "puma-plugin-statsd"
```

Add it to your puma config:

```ruby
# config/puma.rb

bind "http://127.0.0.1:9292"

workers 1
threads 8, 16

plugin :statsd
```

## Configuration

### Statsd Connection

By default the plugin assumes statsd is available at 127.0.0.1. If that's true
in your environment, just start puma like normal:

```
bundle exec puma
```

If statsd isn't on 127.0.0.1 or the UDP port is non-standard, you can configure
them using optional environment variables:

```
STATSD_HOST=127.0.0.1 STATSD_PORT=9125 bundle exec puma
```

Some setups have statsd listening on a Unix socket rather than UDP. In that case, specify the socket path:

```
STATSD_SOCKET_PATH=/tmp/statsd.socket bundle exec puma
```

### Interval

By default values will be reported to statsd every 2 seconds. To customise that
internal, set the `STATSD_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable.

```
STATSD_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1 bundle exec puma
```

Fractional seconds are supported. Here's how you'd opt into 500ms:

```
STATSD_INTERVAL_SECONDS="0.5" bundle exec puma
```

### Prefix

In some environments you may want to prefix the metric names. To report
`foo.puma.pool_capacity` instead of `puma.pool_capacity`:

```
STATSD_METRIC_PREFIX=foo bundle exec puma
```

### Datadog Integration

metric tags are a non-standard addition to the statsd protocol, supported by
the datadog "dogstatsd" server.

Should you be reporting the puma metrics to a dogstatsd server, you can set
tags via the following environment variables.

#### DD_TAGS

`DD_TAGS`: Set this to a space-separated list of tags, using the
[datadog agent standard format](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/docker/?tab=standard#global-options).

For example, you could set this environment variable to set three datadog tags,
and then you can filter by in the datadog interface:

```
DD_TAGS="env:test simple-tag-0 tag-key-1:tag-value-1" bundle exec puma
```

#### DD_ENV, DD_SERVICE, DD_VERSION, DD_ENTITY_ID

The `env`, `service`, `version` and `dd.internal.entity_id` tags have special
meaning to datadog, and they can be set using the above environment variables.
These are the conventional environment variables recommended by datadog, so
they're likely to be set in many deployments.

#### MY_POD_NAME

`MY_POD_NAME`: Set a `pod_name` tag to the metrics. The `MY_POD_NAME`
environment variable is recommended in the datadog kubernetes setup
documentation, and for puma apps deployed to kubernetes it's very helpful to
have the option to report on specific pods.

You can set it on your pods like this:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MY_POD_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name
```

#### STATSD_GROUPING

`STATSD_GROUPING`: add a `grouping` tag to the metrics, with a value equal to
the environment variable value. This is particularly helpful in a kubernetes
deployment where each pod has a unique name but you want the option to group
metrics across all pods in a deployment. Setting this on the pods in a
deployment might look something like:

```yaml
env:
  - name: STATSD_GROUPING
    value: deployment-foo
```

## Testing the data being sent to statsd

Start a pretend statsd server that listens for UDP packets on port 8125.

If you've installed the gem in your app:

    # only need to install the binstub once
    bundle binstubs puma-plugin-statsd
    ./bin/statsd-to-stdout

If you are developing/testing this gem locally:

    ./bin/statsd-to-stdout

Start puma:

    STATSD_HOST=127.0.0.1 bundle exec puma devtools/config.ru --config devtools/puma-config.rb

Throw some traffic at it, either with curl or a tool like ab:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:9292/
    ab -n 10000 -c 20 http://127.0.0.1:9292/

Watch the output of the UDP server process - you should see statsd data printed to stdout.
